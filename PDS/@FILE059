//***FILE 059 is a combination of CLISTs and Assembler programs     *   FILE 059
//*           to display last IPL information and today's date      *   FILE 059
//*           on a handy ISPF panel.  This file is from the late    *   FILE 059
//*           Ken Tomiak of the Dept of Information Technology      *   FILE 059
//*           and Telecommunications (DOITT) of New York City.      *   FILE 059
//*                                                                 *   FILE 059
//*           There is a small addition from Sam Golob.  This is    *   FILE 059
//*           a panel called "IDPANEL" with a REXX exec called      *   FILE 059
//*           "SMCASID" (written by the late Tony Forte).  This     *   FILE 059
//*           panel is meant to be executed via an entry in your    *   FILE 059
//*           ISPF command table ISPCMDS.  This panel shows useful  *   FILE 059
//*           information about your current ISPF session that is   *   FILE 059
//*           invoking it.  The REXX exec "SMCASID" obtains your    *   FILE 059
//*           system id and puts it into an ISPF variable in the    *   FILE 059
//*           shared pool.  This is good if you have multiple       *   FILE 059
//*           systems like we had.  If you have only one system,    *   FILE 059
//*           you can change IDPANEL to delete the references to    *   FILE 059
//*           &SYSID and the command SMCASID which obtains it.      *   FILE 059
//*           Then you don't need the REXX exec.  If you have       *   FILE 059
//*           TSO/E 1.4 or below (without REXX) you have to do      *   FILE 059
//*           this anyway, or use an Assembler program to get the   *   FILE 059
//*           system id into a variable instead.                    *   FILE 059
//*                                                                 *   FILE 059
